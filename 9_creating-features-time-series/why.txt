data can also contain multiple values
that are not independent for each entity. For example, there can be multiple records for
each customer with the details of the customer's transactions within our organization, such
as purchases, payments, claims, deposits, and withdrawals. In other cases, the values of the
variables may change daily, such as stock prices or energy consumption per household. The
first data sources are referred to as transactional data, whereas the second data sources are
time series. Time series and transactional data contain time-stamped observations, which
means they share a time dimension.
