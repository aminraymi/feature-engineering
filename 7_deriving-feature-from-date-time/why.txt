Date and time variables are those that contain information about dates, times, or date and
time. In programming, we refer to these variables as datetime variables. Examples of the
datetime variables are date of birth, time of the accident, and date of last payment. The
datetime variables usually contain a multitude of different labels corresponding to a
specific combination of date and time. We do not utilize the datetime variables in their
raw format when building machine learning models. Instead, we enrich the dataset
dramatically by deriving multiple features from these variables.
