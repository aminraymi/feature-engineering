Many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale and magnitude of the features.
In particular, the coefficients of the linear models depend on the scale of the feature, that is,
changing the feature scale will change the coefficients' value. In linear models, as well as
algorithms that depend on distance calculations, such as clustering and principal
component analysis, features with bigger value ranges tend to dominate over features with
smaller ranges. Thus, having features within a similar scale allows us to compare feature
importance, and also helps algorithms converge faster, thus improving performance and
training times.
