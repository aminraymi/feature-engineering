Variables in their original, raw format are not suitable to train machine learning algorithms.
In fact, we need to consider many aspects of a variable to build powerful machine learning
models. These aspects include variable type, missing data, cardinality and category
frequency, variable distribution and its relationship with the target, outliers, and feature
magnitude.
