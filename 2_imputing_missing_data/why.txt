Missing data refers to the absence of values for certain observations and is an unavoidable
problem in most data sources. Scikit-learn does not support missing values as input, so we
need to remove observations with missing data or transform them into permitted values.
The act of replacing missing data with statistical estimates of missing values is
called imputation.
