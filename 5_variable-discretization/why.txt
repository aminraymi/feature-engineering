Discretization, or binning, is the process of transforming continuous variables into discrete
variables by creating a set of contiguous intervals, also called bins, that span the range of
the variable values. Discretization is used to change the distribution of skewed variables
and to minimize the influence of outliers, and hence improve the performance of some
machine learning models.
